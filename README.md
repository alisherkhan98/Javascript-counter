<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](img/Screenshot.jpg)

As you can see from the screenshot above you have a counter with initial value equal to 0 and to buttons to change that value.

There are also three additional buttons below:

* save: to save the current value of the counter
* view list: to see a list of all saved values and the time they were saved at
* clear list: to delete all saved values

Be careful: you can only save up to 10 values.
